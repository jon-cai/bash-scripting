NAME: lss - long list directory contents in decreasing byte order

SYNOPSIS: lss [OPTION] . . . [FILE] . . .

DESCRIPTION:
List information about files in a given directory, with the current directory as default. Files will be listed with a long listing format and will be sorted by decreasing byte order.

lss will accept the options of “ls” with the exception of a few flags:
   -s : The “ls -ls” size flag adds an extra column to the output, which messes up the sorting function in lss so it is not supported.

   -i : The “ls -li” inode flag adds an extra column to the output, which messes up the sorting function in lss so it is not supported.

   -g : The “ls -lg” flag removes the list owner column in the output, which messes up the sorting function in lss so it is not supported.

All other arguments that lss accepts will be interpreted as filenames and will list only those files in the output. 

Directories will be listed, but will not be descended unless explicitly listed.
